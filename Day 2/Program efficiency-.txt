Program efficiency:-
efficiency is all about time & space complexity

DP(dynamic programing)

In greedy approach whatever is the soln of the program given at the 1st go is fixed as final soln.
Note: This is not the best approach for all sceniroes however it also works for some cases

In DP, we will be finding out all possible solns for given problem out of which the best will be selected. 

TIME AND SPACE COMPLEXITY:

Asymptotic notaions
1)Big Oh(0)
2)theta
3)omega


for(i=0;i<n;i++)      ----n+1
{
statements;   -------n+1
}

f(n) = n+1 = O(n)


for(i=0;i<n;i+2)   
{
statements;   
}

n/2
f(n) = n/2
Degree of polynomial is n
so n/anything is n
so here also 0(n)

so irrespective of iteratn time gonna be same 0(n)


sum of digits of given no using
